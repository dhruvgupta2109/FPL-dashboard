```

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and enter the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvgupta2109/fplmanager.git
cd fpl
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install streamlit certifi
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run live_dashboard.py
```

Then open the local URL shown by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

## How To Find Your Manager ID

1. Open https://fantasy.premierleague.com.
2. Go to your team and open a gameweek points page.
3. In a URL like:
	 `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/entry/1637221/event/26`
	 the value `1637221` is your manager ID.

## Utility Scripts

Run these from the project root.

Fetch and store latest FPL bootstrap data:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_fpl_data.py
```

Generate processed player metrics (value, ppg, form):

```bash
python scripts/read_players.py
```

Track live GW events in terminal:

```bash
python scripts/live_fpl.py
```

Track live events for your own team:

```bash
python scripts/user_live_fpl.py
```

## Data Sources

This app uses public Fantasy Premier League API endpoints, including:

- `/api/bootstrap-static/`
- `/api/event/{gw}/live/`
- `/api/entry/{manager_id}/`
- `/api/entry/{manager_id}/history/`
- `/api/entry/{manager_id}/event/{gw}/picks/`
- `/api/fixtures/?event={gw}`

## Notes

- The app depends on live FPL API availability and may show temporary errors during outages/rate limits.
- Cached calls are used in key sections to reduce repeated requests.
- Some utility scripts expect `data/raw/bootstrap_static.json` to exist (run `fetch_fpl_data.py` first).
